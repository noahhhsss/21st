          <h2>Symbolism</h2>
          <p>
            The mask symbolizes the anonymity of the internet, allowing individuals to hide their true selves while projecting a different persona. It represents both freedom and danger: the freedom to express oneself without fear of judgment, but also the danger of using that anonymity to harm others. In the context of Troll, the mask can be seen as a barrier that shields trolls from accountability, enabling toxic behaviors that have real consequences for the victims.
